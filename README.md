This is a java program that output swing forms for a registration form, allowing a user to ente details and store them in a database.I used a JBDC driver to connect the program to my database(register_db) in my mySQL.When you run the code a GUI is opened in which the user can input the required data.When you submit after inputting the data a second GUI is opened which has all the data which had been entered in the first form is displayed.In the second GUI the user can register after accepting the terms and conditions or exit if he/she chooses.The data is then stored in the database after registering.When you open the registration form document attached you will find pictures of the GUIs and the code i used to create the database.
